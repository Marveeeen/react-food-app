## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Vite, React

A simple food app built with [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) for initial folder structure and [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) for front-end. 

## Take Aways:

- Dynamic UI components
- Modal and backdrop techniques using portals
- The use of useReducer for complex state handling
- useContext for allowing components to consume state without prop chaining
- forwardRef for allowing parent components to access child references
